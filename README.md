# Deals

Deals is a platform for sharing good deals! It allows users to post items which are being sold for discounted prices, or simply the best price they can find for a particular hot item.

The twist is that users share in the revenue generated from the click-throughs generated by the site, thus providing incentive to find them deals!

## Running the app

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
 

For development purposes, you'll want access to your local database. Don't use the default 'postgres' account login/password in production. Obviously.

``` bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"

sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
```

  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
